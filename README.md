- Super High Performance
- Very Simple: Simple header and library file
- Zero Config: no complex config, real out-of-the-box


## Use Cases

- High-frenquency trade (OLTP)
- High-peformance query
- High-peformance data manamgent: You can use CrossDB OnDisk DB to store data on Disk/Flash/SSD.
- High-peformance IMDB: You can use CrossDB In-Memory DB to manage Process Runtime Data to replace STL or hand-written data structures.
- You can use CrossDB RamDisk DB to support Process Restartability, In-Service Software Upgrade(ISSU) easily.
- You can use CrossDB to work as a super fast cache DB.
